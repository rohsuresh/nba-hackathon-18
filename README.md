There are two sections to this project. The basketball-data section includes an investigation into a game dataset to calculate player +/-.
The business-data section includes a training set for NBA game international viewership. The jupyter notebook provides insights into how we generated predictions for game viewership using Ridge and Lasso Regresssion through Scikit-learn.
